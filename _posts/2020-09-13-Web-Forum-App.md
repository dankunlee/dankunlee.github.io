# Intro

I built a simple RESTful web forum application. 

The back-end was built using Spring Boot. 

It was hosted locally and an android app was built to test the functionalities of the server. 

The back-end part can be found [here](link) and the app can be found [here](https://github.com/dankunlee/Web-Forum-Android-App).

# Demo

Below video demonstrates how the app functions.
